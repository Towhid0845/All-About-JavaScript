🌟 Why Functions? 🌟 
    You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
    You can use the same code many times with different arguments, 
    to produce different results.
    
    OR

    A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere 
    in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code 
    again and again.

    DRY => do not repeat yourself

🌟 Difference between getElementById and querySelector 🌟
    ✅ getElementById 
    Syntex: 
    element = document.getElementById(id);
        it returns a reference to the element by its ID.
        If the element with specified ID is not in the document, then it will returns null.

    ✅ querySelector()
    Syntex:
    element = document.querySelector(selector);

🌟 Difference between synchronous and asynchronoum JavaScript 🌟
    synchronous programming follows FCFS (first come first serve) approach
    whereas asynchronous programming follows SJF (shortest job first) approach.

    🗄️ see the detail of 'Synchronous Programming in JS' in index.js


🌟 What is event loop in JavaScript 🌟
    🗄️ see the detail of 'The Event Loop in JavaScript' in index.js


🌟 What is the output of sum(5)(3)(8) 🌟
    🗄️ see the detail of 'Curring' in index.js
